### Firebase Spark Plan Limitations
1. **Storage**
   - 1GB storage limit
   - 10GB/month transfer
   - 5GB Storage bucket

2. **Connections**
   - Limited concurrent connections
   - No dedicated TURN server

3. **Operations**
   - Limited document reads/writes
   - Limited simultaneous listeners

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Data Management**
   - Implement message pagination
   - Cleanup old signaling data
   - Compress media where possible
   - Cache frequently accessed data

2. **Connection Management**
   - Use free STUN servers
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Optimize listener attachments
   - Smart reconnection strategy

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Lazy loading of media
   - Efficient indexing
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Implement rate limiting

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- [x] Basic WebRTC implementation
- [x] Audio/Video calls
- [x] Basic UI controls
- [x] Firebase signaling

### Phase 2 (Next Steps)
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Connection stability
- [ ] UI/UX polish
