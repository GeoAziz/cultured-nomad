## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated electric purple (#BE29EC) to convey futurism and female empowerment. The color symbolizes the energy of forward-thinking female leaders.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated purple (#0A030B), creating a dark futuristic feel while complementing the primary color.
- Accent color: A bright electric blue (#29A0EC) to highlight interactive elements and add contrast.
- Body: 'Inter', sans-serif. Headline: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. Use 'Space Grotesk' for headlines and short amounts of body text; if longer text is anticipated, use this for headlines and 'Inter' for body. Inter and Space Grotesk fit the technical aesthetic.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Neon-glowing icons to match Zizo Aesthetics, including social networking glyphs, notification symbols, and controls.
- Use a consistent grid system and modular components to maintain a clean and responsive layout.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations (using Framer Motion) for UI elements to enhance user engagement.
